# Fairfake

UTK_Face_VAE.ipynb sets up a VAE and generates images of faces to be trained on with a CNN

UTK_Face_GAN.ipynb trains a GAN with the UTKFace images

Balancing-GAN-UTKFace.ipynb uses the Balancing GAN (existing method) to generate facial images

DB-VAE-LargeUTKFace.ipynb uses DBVAE (existing method) with all races

DB-VAE-UTKFace.ipynb uses DBVAE (existing method) with just black and white faces

GAN_Balanced.ipynb uses the images from the GAN to train and test the CNN

Simple_CNN_5k (2).ipynb simply trains and tests the original CNN (no fake images)

VAE_Balanced uses the images from the VAE to train and test the CNN
